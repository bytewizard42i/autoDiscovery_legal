// Proof Server Messages

    `This is the local service that builds your zero-knowledge proofs.`,

  healthySlow: (responseTimeMs: number) =>
    `The proof server is running but responding slowly (${responseTimeMs}ms). ` +
    `Proof generation might take longer than usual. ` +
    `If this persists, try restarting the Docker container.`,

  critical:
    `The proof server is not reachable. ` +
    `This is the service that builds zero-knowledge proofs on your machine. ` +
    `Without it, you can still browse and read data, but you cannot submit ` +
    `any transactions (create cases, register documents, etc.).`,

    `This could be network congestion or indexer lag.`,

  critical:
    `The Midnight preprod network is not reachable. ` +
    `This means we cannot read any data from the blockchain or submit transactions. ` +
    `The network might be down for maintenance, or your internet connection might be interrupted.`,

  criticalSuggestion:
    `Check your internet connection first. If that's fine, the Midnight preprod ` +
    `network might be experiencing downtime. This happens occasionally as the ` +
    `team prepares for mainnet. Try again in a few minutes.`,
