# 🗺️ AutoDiscovery — State-by-State Rollout Strategy

> **Idaho first. Then everywhere. One jurisdiction at a time.**

---

## 📋 Overview

This document defines the phased, state-by-state launch strategy for AutoDiscovery — starting in **Idaho** as the anchor jurisdiction and expanding methodically across the US. Each state is treated as its own product release with discrete compliance checkpoints, legal validation gates, and measurable success criteria before the next state is opened.

The modular `jurisdiction-registry` smart contract is built for exactly this model: **add new rule packs without code changes.**

---

## 🏗️ Rollout Philosophy

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Depth before breadth** | Own Idaho completely before opening Utah |
| **Validate before replicate** | Each state launch proves the template for the next |
| **Legal-first sequencing** | Compliance checkpoints gate every expansion |
| **Metrics-driven gates** | No new state opens without prior state hitting KPIs |
| **Modular by design** | Rule packs are pluggable — architecture never changes |

---

## 🗓️ Master Expansion Timeline

```
2026 Q2 ──── Idaho (Anchor Launch)
2026 Q3 ──── Utah
2026 Q4 ──── Washington
2027 Q1 ──── Nevada
2027 Q2 ──── Wyoming
2027 Q3 ──── Montana
2027 Q4 ──── California
2028 Q1 ──── New York
2028 Q2 to 2028 Q4 ──── Remaining US states (batch rollout)
```

## 🥔 PHASE 1 — Idaho Anchor Launch (Q2 2026)

### 🎯 **Why Idaho First**
- Spy's primary jurisdiction — 20+ years complex litigation paralegal experience here
- IRCP (adopted July 1, 2016, modeled on 2015 federal amendments) is well-documented and stable
- ~6,000 ISB members — small enough to move fast, significant enough to prove the model
- Idaho State Bar is approachable and has an active Technology Committee
- Win here = credible, domain-expert-backed proof of concept for every subsequent state

---

### 🏛️ **Idaho Court System — Structure AutoDiscovery Must Support**

Idaho has **7 Judicial Districts**, each with its own District Court and local rules that layer on top of IRCP:

| District | Counties | Seat | Notes |
|----------|----------|------|-------|
| **1st** | Shoshone, Kootenai, Benewah, Boundary, Bonner | Coeur d'Alene | High case volume, Kootenai County |
| **2nd** | Nez Perce, Lewis, Latah, Clearwater, Idaho | Lewiston / Moscow | University of Idaho — complex civil matters |
| **3rd** | Adams, Canyon, Gem, Owyhee, Payette, Washington | Caldwell | Canyon County — 2nd largest in ID |
| **4th** | Ada, Boise, Elmore, Valley | Boise | **Highest volume** — primary target market |
| **5th** | Blaine, Camas, Cassia, Gooding, Jerome, Lincoln, Minidoka, Twin Falls | Twin Falls | Sun Valley — complex real estate/injury |
| **6th** | Bear Lake, Bannock, Caribou, Franklin, Oneida, Power | Pocatello | ISU area |
| **7th** | Bingham, Bonneville, Butte, Clark, Custer, Fremont, Jefferson, Lemhi, Madison, Teton | Idaho Falls | Eastern Idaho hub |

> **AutoDiscovery v1.0 targets:** 4th District (Ada County / Boise) as primary, 3rd and 6th as secondary.

### 📜 **IRCP Discovery Rules — Detailed Mapping**

The Idaho Rules of Civil Procedure were comprehensively revised effective **July 1, 2016**, closely following the 2015 Federal Rules amendments. AutoDiscovery must correctly implement every rule below.

#### Core Discovery Rules to Implement

| Rule | Title | Key AutoDiscovery Function |
|------|-------|---------------------------|
| **IRCP 16** | Pretrial Conferences; Scheduling | Scheduling order ingestion — sets all downstream deadlines |
| **IRCP 26(a)(1)** | Initial Disclosures | Auto-trigger at case creation; 14-day deadline from scheduling conference |
| **IRCP 26(a)(2)** | Expert Witness Disclosures | Expert designation workflow; SOC documentation; W-9/I-9 collection |
| **IRCP 26(a)(3)** | Pretrial Disclosures | Final exhibit/witness lists; 30 days before trial |
| **IRCP 26(b)(1)** | Scope of Discovery | Proportionality analysis for document requests |
| **IRCP 26(b)(2)** | Limitations on Discovery | ESI not reasonably accessible — cost-shifting analysis |
| **IRCP 26(b)(3)** | Trial Preparation — Work Product | Privilege log generation and management |
| **IRCP 26(c)** | Protective Orders | Protective order request workflow |
| **IRCP 26(f)** | Conference of the Parties | Meet-and-confer scheduling and documentation |
| **IRCP 33** | Interrogatories | 25-interrogatory limit; 28-day response deadline |
| **IRCP 34** | Requests for Production | Document/ESI production; 28-day response deadline |
| **IRCP 35** | Physical/Mental Examinations | Independent medical examination (IME) workflows |
| **IRCP 36** | Requests for Admission | 28-day response; deemed admitted on failure |
| **IRCP 37** | Sanctions for Discovery Failures | Sanction risk flags and compliance alerts |
| **IRCP 45** | Subpoenas | Third-party document subpoena tracking |

#### ⏰ IRCP Deadline Table — AutoDiscovery Must Calculate All of These

| Deadline | Trigger | Days | Notes |
|----------|---------|------|-------|
| **Initial disclosures** | Scheduling conference | +14 days | IRCP 26(a)(1) |
| **Interrogatory responses** | Service of interrogatories | +28 days | IRCP 33; extendable by stipulation |
| **RFP responses** | Service of RFP | +28 days | IRCP 34 |
| **RFA responses** | Service of RFA | +28 days | IRCP 36; failure = admitted |
| **Expert disclosures (plaintiff)** | Per scheduling order | Usually 90 days pre-trial | IRCP 26(a)(2) |
| **Expert disclosures (defendant)** | After plaintiff's | +30 days | IRCP 26(a)(2) |
| **Rebuttal experts** | After defendant's disclosure | +30 days | IRCP 26(a)(2) |
| **Pretrial disclosures** | Before trial | -30 days | IRCP 26(a)(3) |
| **Discovery cutoff** | Per scheduling order | Usually -90 days from trial | Set by district judge |
| **Deposition notice** | Before deposition | Reasonable (~14 days) | IRCP 30 |
| **Deposition objections** | After transcript | +30 days | IRCP 32 |

> ⚠️ **Critical:** Failure to serve timely RFA responses results in automatic admission (IRCP 36(a)(3)). AutoDiscovery must flag this deadline with **CRITICAL** alert level.

---

### ⚖️ **Idaho UPL Analysis — Detailed Assessment**

This is a legal gate. AutoDiscovery **cannot launch** until this analysis is complete and documented.

#### Governing Statutes & Rules

| Authority | Provision | Relevance |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Idaho Code § 3-104** | Only licensed attorneys may practice law in Idaho | AutoDiscovery must not constitute "practice of law" |
| **Idaho Code § 3-420** | Unauthorized practice is a misdemeanor | Criminal exposure if UPL occurs |
| **ISB Rule 5.5** | Multi-jurisdictional practice | Governs out-of-state attorney use |
| **Idaho RPC 1.1** | Competence includes technology | Supports attorney use of AutoDiscovery |
| **Idaho RPC 5.3** | Supervision of non-lawyer assistants | AutoDiscovery = non-lawyer tool under attorney supervision |

#### UPL Safe Harbor Analysis

AutoDiscovery avoids UPL under Idaho law because:

1. **Tool, not advisor** — AutoDiscovery enforces rules set by the Idaho legislature; it does not give legal advice
2. **Attorney supervision** — The attorney of record retains all judgment and discretion; AutoDiscovery surfaces deadlines, the attorney decides strategy
3. **Scrivener function** — Populating forms and calculating deadlines is a scrivener function, not legal practice (analogous to court-approved legal form software)
4. **Precedent** — The ISB has found that legal software tools (Clio, Westlaw, etc.) do not constitute UPL when used under attorney supervision

#### Required UPL Documentation (Pre-Launch Gate)
- [ ] Written UPL memo from Idaho-licensed attorney confirming safe harbor
- [ ] ToS language affirming AutoDiscovery is a tool, not legal counsel
- [ ] In-app disclaimer: *"AutoDiscovery is a compliance automation tool. It does not constitute legal advice. All decisions remain with the supervising attorney."*
- [ ] ISB Ethics Opinion inquiry (informal) — confirm no objection

---

### 🏥 **Idaho Medical Malpractice — Primary Use Case Deep Dive**

Medical malpractice is AutoDiscovery's anchor use case. Idaho has specific statutory requirements beyond IRCP:

#### Governing Statutes

| Statute | Provision | AutoDiscovery Implementation |
|---------|-----------|------------------------------|
| **Idaho Code § 6-1001** | Medical Malpractice Act scope | Case type flag — triggers malpractice workflow |
| **Idaho Code § 6-1003** | Pre-litigation screening panel required | Panel request tracking + deadline |
| **Idaho Code § 6-1004** | Panel composition | Expert witness management — panel member tracking |
| **Idaho Code § 6-1007** | Expert affidavit of merit | Auto-flag at case creation — affidavit deadline |
| **Idaho Code § 6-1603** | Non-economic damage cap: $250,000 | Case valuation flag |
| **Idaho Code § 5-219(4)** | Statute of limitations: 2 years from discovery | SOL calculator — alert if approaching |

#### Medical Malpractice Discovery Checklist (Idaho-Specific)

- [ ] **Pre-litigation panel** — Track submission, composition, and 180-day review period
- [ ] **Expert affidavit of merit** — Must be filed at complaint; track deadline
- [ ] **Standard of Care (SOC)** expert identification and documentation
- [ ] **Expert W-9/I-9** collection workflow (existing in `expert-witness` contract)
- [ ] **IME scheduling** — Independent Medical Examination under IRCP 35
- [ ] **HIPAA authorization** tracking — Idaho follows federal HIPAA; document patient authorizations
- [ ] **Medical records request** deadlines — 30-day response under Idaho Code § 9-420A
- [ ] **Privilege log** for any withheld provider communications

---

### 🗂️ **Idaho District Local Rules — Mapping Required**

Each judicial district adds local rules on top of IRCP. AutoDiscovery must handle at least the **4th District** at launch:

#### 4th District (Ada County / Boise) — Priority

| Local Rule | Topic | Implementation |
|------------|-------|----------------|
| **IDLR 16** | Case Management Orders | Auto-ingest scheduling order deadlines |
| **IDLR 26** | ESI Protocol | Default ESI production format (TIFF/native) |
| **IDLR 37** | Discovery Disputes | Required meet-and-confer documentation before motion |
| **CV-1 Standing Order** | Case scheduling | Some judges issue standing orders — flag for manual entry |

> **Action:** Obtain current 4th District local rules from `adacounty.id.gov/district-court`. Verify annually.

---

### 🔒 **Idaho Data Privacy & Security Requirements**

| Law / Rule | Requirement | AutoDiscovery Compliance |
|------------|-------------|--------------------------|
| **Idaho Code § 28-51-104** | Data breach notification within 30 days | Midnight private ledger = encrypted at rest; breach protocol documented |
| **Idaho Code § 28-51-105** | Reasonable security measures required | ZK architecture + Lace wallet key management satisfies this |
| **HIPAA (Federal)** | Medical records — covered entity rules | AutoDiscovery does not store PHI; document handling is client-side |
| **Idaho RPC 1.6** | Attorney duty of confidentiality | Selective disclosure + private ledger satisfies this |
| **Idaho RPC 1.15** | Safekeeping of client property | Documents on client's machine; AutoDiscovery holds only hashes |

---

## 🏔️ PHASE 2 — Utah (Q3 2026)

### 🎯 **Why Utah Second**
- Adjacent to Idaho — many Pacific Northwest firms practice in both states
- URCP closely mirrors IRCP with known, documented divergence points
- Spy has existing research depth on Utah rules from prior jurisdiction work
- Doubles TAM with minimal new engineering — Idaho template carries ~80% over
- ~14,000 licensed Utah attorneys; 3rd District (Salt Lake) is the largest market

---

### 🏛️ **Utah Court System — Structure AutoDiscovery Must Support**

Utah has **8 Judicial Districts** under the Utah Supreme Court:

| District | Counties | Seat | Notes |
|----------|----------|------|-------|
| **1st** | Cache, Rich, Box Elder | Logan | Northern Utah |
| **2nd** | Weber, Davis, Morgan | Ogden | Wasatch Front |
| **3rd** | Salt Lake, Summit, Tooele | Salt Lake City | **Highest volume — primary target** |
| **4th** | Utah, Wasatch, Juab | Provo | Utah County — fast-growing |
| **5th** | Iron, Beaver, Washington | Cedar City / St. George | Southern Utah |
| **6th** | Sevier, Piute, Sanpete, Wayne, Millard, Garfield, Kane | Richfield | Rural |
| **7th** | Carbon, Emery, Grand, San Juan | Price | Eastern Utah |
| **8th** | Duchesne, Uintah, Daggard | Vernal | Uinta Basin |

> **AutoDiscovery v1.0 (Utah) targets:** 3rd District (Salt Lake County) primary, 4th District (Utah County) secondary.

---

### � **URCP Discovery Rules — Divergence Map from IRCP**

Utah Rules of Civil Procedure (URCP) were substantially revised in 2004 and track the federal model closely — but diverge from IRCP in several important areas AutoDiscovery must handle correctly.

#### Core Discovery Rules — URCP vs IRCP Comparison

| Rule | URCP | IRCP | Key Difference |
|------|------|------|----------------|
| **Initial Disclosures** | URCP 26(a)(1) — 14 days | IRCP 26(a)(1) — 14 days | ✅ Identical |
| **Interrogatory Limit** | URCP 33 — 25 limit | IRCP 33 — 25 limit | ✅ Identical |
| **Interrogatory Response** | URCP 33 — 28 days | IRCP 33 — 28 days | ✅ Identical |
| **RFP Response** | URCP 34 — 28 days | IRCP 34 — 28 days | ✅ Identical |
| **RFA Response** | URCP 36 — 28 days | IRCP 36 — 28 days | ✅ Identical |
| **Expert Disclosures** | URCP 26(a)(4) — per scheduling order | IRCP 26(a)(2) — per scheduling order | ⚠️ Rule number differs |
| **Proportionality** | URCP 26(b)(1) — explicit proportionality | IRCP 26(b)(1) — same | ✅ Substantially identical |
| **Protective Orders** | URCP 26(c) | IRCP 26(c) | ✅ Identical |
| **Sanctions** | URCP 37 | IRCP 37 | ✅ Substantially identical |
| **Tier System** | **URCP 26(c)(3) — Tiered discovery by case type** | No tier system | ⚠️ **MAJOR DIFFERENCE — see below** |

#### ⚠️ URCP Tier System — Critical Utah-Specific Implementation

Utah's most significant divergence from Idaho: **URCP 26(c)(3) establishes a mandatory discovery tier system** based on the amount in controversy:

| Tier | Amount in Controversy | Discovery Limits | AutoDiscovery Implementation |
|------|----------------------|-----------------|------------------------------|
| **Tier 1** | Under $50,000 | 10 interrogatories, 3 depositions, no experts | Simplified workflow; flag if case type suggests higher value |
| **Tier 2** | $50,000–$300,000 | 20 interrogatories, 5 depositions | Standard workflow |
| **Tier 3** | Over $300,000 | 40 interrogatories, no deposition limit | Full workflow |

> ⚠️ AutoDiscovery must prompt for Utah tier designation at case creation and enforce correct limits per tier throughout the workflow.

#### ⏰ URCP Deadline Table

| Deadline | Trigger | Days | Notes |
|----------|---------|------|-------|
| **Initial disclosures** | Scheduling conference | +14 days | URCP 26(a)(1) — same as IRCP |
| **Interrogatory responses** | Service | +28 days | URCP 33 |
| **RFP responses** | Service | +28 days | URCP 34 |
| **RFA responses** | Service | +28 days | URCP 36; failure = admitted |
| **Expert disclosures (plaintiff)** | Per scheduling order | Usually 60–90 days pre-trial | URCP 26(a)(4) |
| **Expert disclosures (defendant)** | After plaintiff's | +14 days | URCP 26(a)(4) — shorter than IRCP's +30 |
| **Rebuttal experts** | After defendant's | +14 days | URCP 26(a)(4) |
| **Discovery cutoff** | Per scheduling order | Per judge's order | URCP 16 |
| **Pretrial disclosures** | Before trial | -28 days | URCP 26(a)(5) |

> ⚠️ **Key difference:** Utah's defendant expert rebuttal window is **+14 days** (Idaho is +30). This must be coded as a fork in the rule pack.

---

### ⚖️ **Utah UPL Analysis**

| Authority | Provision | Relevance |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Utah Code § 78A-9-103** | Definition of practice of law | AutoDiscovery must fall outside this definition |
| **Utah Code § 78A-9-102** | UPL prohibition | Civil and criminal penalties |
| **Utah RPC 5.5** | Multi-jurisdictional practice | Out-of-state attorney access |
| **Utah RPC 1.1** | Competence includes technology | Supports use |
| **Utah State Bar Ethics Hotline** | (801) 531-9077 | Submit informal inquiry pre-launch |

> Same safe harbor argument as Idaho applies. Memo required. Submit USB Ethics Hotline inquiry before beta launch.

---

### 🔒 **Utah Data Privacy Requirements**

| Law | Requirement | AutoDiscovery Compliance |
|-----|-------------|--------------------------|
| **Utah Consumer Privacy Act (UCPA)** | Effective Dec 31, 2023 — consumer data rights | AutoDiscovery stores hashes only; no personal data in ledger |
| **Utah Code § 13-44-202** | Data breach notification — 30 days | Midnight architecture satisfies; breach protocol documented |
| **Utah RPC 1.6** | Confidentiality | Private ledger + selective disclosure satisfies |
| **HIPAA (Federal)** | Medical records | Client-side handling; AutoDiscovery holds hashes only |

> **AutoDiscovery v1.0 (Washington) targets:** King County primary, Pierce and Snohomish secondary.

---

### 📜 **Washington CR Discovery Rules — Divergence Map**

Washington Superior Court Civil Rules (CR) diverge from IRCP in several significant areas:

#### Core Discovery Rules — CR vs IRCP Comparison

| Rule | WA CR | IRCP | Key Difference |
|------|-------|------|----------------|
| **Initial Disclosures** | CR 26(a) — required | IRCP 26(a)(1) | ✅ Substantially similar |
| **Interrogatory Limit** | **CR 33 — 40 limit** | IRCP 33 — 25 limit | ⚠️ **WA allows 40; Idaho only 25** |
| **Interrogatory Response** | CR 33 — 30 days | IRCP 33 — 28 days | ⚠️ **WA = 30 days; Idaho = 28 days** |
| **RFP Response** | CR 34 — 30 days | IRCP 34 — 28 days | ⚠️ **WA = 30 days; Idaho = 28 days** |
| **RFA Response** | CR 36 — 30 days | IRCP 36 — 28 days | ⚠️ **WA = 30 days; Idaho = 28 days** |
| **Expert Disclosures** | CR 26(b)(5) — per order | IRCP 26(a)(2) — per order | ⚠️ Rule structure differs |
| **ESI Production** | CR 34 + KCLCR Standing Order | IRCP 34 | ⚠️ King County has specific ESI standing order |
| **Proportionality** | CR 26(b) | IRCP 26(b)(1) | ✅ Similar |
| **Sanctions** | CR 37 | IRCP 37 | ✅ Substantially similar |
| **Deposition by Remote Means** | CR 30(b)(7) — explicit | IRCP 30 | ⚠️ WA has specific remote deposition rules |

> ⚠️ **Critical:** Washington's response deadline for all written discovery is **30 days**, not 28. All deadline calculations must fork here — this affects interrogatories, RFPs, and RFAs simultaneously.

#### ⏰ Washington CR Deadline Table

| Deadline | Trigger | Days | Notes |
|----------|---------|------|-------|
| **Initial disclosures** | Scheduling conference | +14 days | CR 26(a) |
| **Interrogatory responses** | Service | **+30 days** | CR 33 — 2 more days than Idaho/Utah |
| **RFP responses** | Service | **+30 days** | CR 34 |
| **RFA responses** | Service | **+30 days** | CR 36; failure = admitted |
| **Expert disclosures (plaintiff)** | Per scheduling order | Per judge | CR 26(b)(5) |
| **Expert disclosures (defendant)** | After plaintiff's | Per judge | CR 26(b)(5) |
| **Discovery cutoff** | Per scheduling order | Per judge | CR 16 |
| **Pretrial disclosures** | Before trial | -30 days | CR 26(a) |
| **Deposition notice** | Before deposition | Reasonable (~10 days) | CR 30 |

---

### 🏙️ **King County Local Rules — Critical for Seattle Market**

King County Superior Court has its own Local Civil Rules (KCLCR) that layer on top of Washington CR:

| Local Rule | Topic | Implementation |
|------------|-------|----------------|

### 🔒 **Washington Data Privacy — Strongest in the Pacific NW**

Washington has some of the most aggressive state privacy laws in the US:

| Law | Requirement | AutoDiscovery Compliance |
|-----|-------------|--------------------------|
| **Washington Privacy Act (WPA)** | Comprehensive consumer data rights (effective July 31, 2023) | Hash-only ledger; no personal data stored |
| **My Health MY Data Act (MHMDA)** | Strict health data protections (effective March 31, 2024) | Medical case data handled client-side only |
| **RCW 19.255.010** | Data breach notification — 30 days | Midnight architecture satisfies; breach protocol documented |
| **Washington RPC 1.6** | Attorney confidentiality | ZK selective disclosure satisfies |
| **HIPAA (Federal)** | Medical records | Client-side; AutoDiscovery holds hashes only |

> ⚠️ **Washington's My Health MY Data Act** is broader than HIPAA and covers health information even when handled by non-covered entities. Confirm medical case data never touches AutoDiscovery's servers.

#### Core Discovery Rules — NRCP vs IRCP Comparison

| Rule | NRCP | IRCP | Key Difference |
|------|------|------|----------------|
| **Initial Disclosures** | NRCP 16.1 — 14 days after Rule 16 conference | IRCP 26(a)(1) — 14 days | ✅ Identical |
| **Interrogatory Limit** | NRCP 33 — **25 limit** | IRCP 33 — 25 limit | ✅ Identical |
| **Interrogatory Response** | NRCP 33 — **30 days** | IRCP 33 — 28 days | ⚠️ Nevada = 30 days |
| **RFP Response** | NRCP 34 — **30 days** | IRCP 34 — 28 days | ⚠️ Nevada = 30 days |
| **RFA Response** | NRCP 36 — **30 days** | IRCP 36 — 28 days | ⚠️ Nevada = 30 days; failure = admitted |
| **Expert Disclosures** | NRCP 16.1(a)(2) — per scheduling order | IRCP 26(a)(2) | ✅ Substantially identical |
| **Proportionality** | NRCP 26(b)(1) | IRCP 26(b)(1) | ✅ Identical |
| **Protective Orders** | NRCP 26(c) | IRCP 26(c) | ✅ Identical |
| **Sanctions** | NRCP 37 | IRCP 37 | ✅ Identical |

> ⚠️ **Only critical divergence:** Nevada's written discovery response deadline is **30 days** (same as WA, TX, FL). Idaho/Utah = 28. Fork already exists from Washington build — reuse directly.

### 📜 **California CCP Discovery Rules — Divergence Map**

California's discovery system (CCP §§ 2016.010–2036.050) is structurally different from the IRCP/URCP/CR federal model — it uses its own statutory framework, not numbered civil rules. AutoDiscovery must map CCP sections, not rule numbers.

#### Core Discovery — CCP vs IRCP Comparison

| Discovery Type | CCP Section | IRCP Equivalent | Key Difference |
|----------------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Initial Disclosures** | None required | IRCP 26(a)(1) | ⚠️ **California has NO mandatory initial disclosures** |
| **Form Interrogatories** | CCP § 2030.010 | IRCP 33 | ⚠️ Unlimited form interrogatories using Judicial Council forms |
| **Special Interrogatories** | CCP § 2030.030 | IRCP 33 | ⚠️ **35 limit** (vs 25 in Idaho); propound in sets |
| **Interrogatory Response** | CCP § 2030.260 | IRCP 33 | ⚠️ **30 days** from service (not 28) |
| **Inspection Demands (RFP)** | CCP § 2031.010 | IRCP 34 | ⚠️ **30 days** from service |
| **Requests for Admission** | CCP § 2033.010 | IRCP 36 | ⚠️ **30 days**; no numerical limit |
| **Depositions** | CCP § 2025.010 | IRCP 30 | ⚠️ **35-deposition limit per side** absent court order |
| **Physical/Mental Exams** | CCP § 2032.010 | IRCP 35 | ✅ Similar |
| **Expert Witness Exchange** | CCP § 2034.010 | IRCP 26(a)(2) | ⚠️ **Simultaneous exchange** — both parties exchange on same day (no sequential) |
| **Expert Cutoff** | CCP § 2034.230 | IRCP 26(a)(2) | ⚠️ 50 days before trial for demand; 20 days to exchange after demand |
| **Discovery Cutoff** | CCP § 2024.020 | Per scheduling order | ⚠️ **30 days before initial trial date** — statutory, not judge-set |
| **ESI** | CCP § 2031.280 | IRCP 34 | ⚠️ California-specific ESI production form requirements |

> ⚠️ **Three critical California-specific implementations required:**
> 1. **No initial disclosures workflow** — CA cases skip this step entirely
> 2. **Simultaneous expert exchange** — both sides exchange on the same day
> 3. **Statutory discovery cutoff** — 30 days before trial, by statute, not court order

#### ⏰ California CCP Deadline Table

| Deadline | Trigger | Days | Notes |
|----------|---------|------|-------|
| **Initial disclosures** | — | N/A | **Not required in California** |
| **Interrogatory responses** | Service | **+30 days** | CCP § 2030.260 |
| **RFP responses** | Service | **+30 days** | CCP § 2031.260 |
| **RFA responses** | Service | **+30 days** | CCP § 2033.250 |
| **Expert demand** | Before cutoff | -50 days before trial | CCP § 2034.220 |
| **Expert exchange** | After demand served | +20 days | CCP § 2034.230 — **simultaneous** |
| **Discovery cutoff** | Trial date | -30 days | CCP § 2024.020 — **statutory** |
| **Motion to compel** | After response due | +45 days | CCP § 2030.300 |
| **Deposition notice** | Before deposition | +10 days minimum | CCP § 2025.270 |

---

### 📋 **California Judicial Council Forms — Key Differentiator**

California mandates Judicial Council forms for many discovery functions. AutoDiscovery auto-populating these is a major competitive differentiator:

| Form | Purpose | AutoDiscovery Implementation |
|------|---------|------------------------------|
| **DISC-001** | Form Interrogatories — General | Auto-populate and serve |
| **DISC-002** | Form Interrogatories — Limited Civil | Tier-aware auto-selection |
| **DISC-003** | Form Interrogatories — Employment | Employment case workflow trigger |
| **DISC-004** | Form Interrogatories — Construction | Construction case workflow trigger |
| **DISC-010** | Requests for Admission | Auto-populate standard RFAs |
| **DISC-020** | Form Interrogatories — Unlawful Detainer | UD case workflow |
| **ER-100** | Expert Witness Declaration | Expert witness module auto-population |
| **AT-140** | Substitution of Attorney | Attorney change tracking |

---

### 🔒 **California Privacy Laws — Most Complex in the US**

| Law | Requirement | AutoDiscovery Compliance |
|-----|-------------|--------------------------|
| **CCPA (Civil Code § 1798.100)** | Consumer data access and deletion rights | Hash-only ledger; no consumer personal data stored |
| **CPRA (Prop 24, eff. Jan 1 2023)** | Expanded CCPA + sensitive personal information category | Confirmed: AutoDiscovery stores no SPI |
| **California Privacy Rights Act** | Right to correct, limit use of SPI | N/A — no SPI stored |
| **Health & Safety Code § 123110** | Patient medical records access (30 days) | Client-side; AutoDiscovery holds hashes only |
| **Civil Code § 1798.82** | Data breach notification — 72 hours (most aggressive in US) | Midnight architecture + incident response plan documented |
| **California RPC 1.6** | Attorney confidentiality | ZK selective disclosure satisfies |
| **HIPAA + CMIA** | Medical records + California Medical Information Act | Client-side handling; dual compliance confirmed |

> ⚠️ California's breach notification window is **72 hours** — the most aggressive in the US. Incident response plan must be documented and rehearsed before CA launch.

---

### ⚖️ **California UPL Analysis**

| Authority | Provision | Relevance |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Business & Professions Code § 6125** | Only licensed CA attorneys may practice law | AutoDiscovery must not constitute practice of law |

- ~180,000 licensed New York attorneys — 2nd largest legal market after California
- NYC enterprise success enables national Big Law and corporate legal department sales

---

### 🏛️ **New York Court System — Structure AutoDiscovery Must Support**

New York's court system is uniquely complex — multiple trial court types with overlapping jurisdiction:

| Court | Jurisdiction | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| **Supreme Court (NYC)** | General jurisdiction — unlimited civil | **Primary target** — misleadingly named; it's the trial court |
| **Supreme Court (Upstate)** | General jurisdiction outside NYC | Albany, Buffalo, Rochester markets |
| **Civil Court of the City of NY** | Claims up to $25,000 | NYC small claims civil docket |
| **County Court** | Upstate counties — felony + civil >$0 | Outside NYC general jurisdiction |
| **Court of Claims** | Claims against NY State | State government litigation |
| **Surrogate's Court** | Estates and trusts | Probate discovery |
| **Family Court** | Family matters | Limited discovery |

#### 4 Appellate Divisions — Each With Distinct Local Rules

| Department | Geographic Coverage | Key Markets |
|------------|--------------------|----|
| **1st Dept** | Manhattan, Bronx | NYC — BigLaw, financial, commercial |
| **2nd Dept** | Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, Long Island, Lower Hudson | NYC boroughs + suburbs |
| **3rd Dept** | Rest of upstate NY (excl. 4th Dept) | Albany, Capital Region |
| **4th Dept** | Western NY | Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse |

> **AutoDiscovery v1.0 (New York) targets:** Supreme Court NYC (1st and 2nd Dept) primary; upstate Supreme Courts secondary.

---

### 📜 **CPLR Discovery Rules — Divergence Map**

New York's Civil Practice Law and Rules (CPLR) Article 31 governs discovery. It diverges significantly from the federal model used by Idaho/Utah/Washington:

#### Core Discovery — CPLR vs IRCP Comparison

| Discovery Type | CPLR | IRCP Equivalent | Key Difference |
|----------------|------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Initial Disclosures** | CPLR 3101(a) — "full disclosure" standard | IRCP 26(a)(1) | ⚠️ NY uses broader "material and necessary" standard; no initial disclosure form |
| **Interrogatories** | CPLR 3130 — **NYC: 25 limit**; upstate: unlimited by default | IRCP 33 — 25 limit | ⚠️ NYC cap = 25; upstate varies by local rule |
| **Interrogatory Response** | CPLR 3133 — **20 days** | IRCP 33 — 28 days | ⚠️ **NY = 20 days — significantly shorter** |
| **Document Demands (RFP)** | CPLR 3120 — **20 days** response | IRCP 34 — 28 days | ⚠️ **NY = 20 days** |
| **Notices to Admit (RFA)** | CPLR 3123 — **20 days** response | IRCP 36 — 28 days | ⚠️ **NY = 20 days**; failure = admitted |
| **Depositions** | CPLR 3106 — 20 days notice | IRCP 30 | ⚠️ 20-day deposition notice |
| **Physical/Mental Exams** | CPLR 3121 | IRCP 35 | ✅ Substantially similar |
| **Expert Disclosure** | CPLR 3101(d) — **no deadline by statute**; per scheduling order | IRCP 26(a)(2) | ⚠️ Expert disclosure timing set by court order only; no statutory default |
| **Discovery Cutoff** | Per Note of Issue / Preliminary Conference Order | Per scheduling order | ⚠️ Note of Issue filing triggers discovery close |
| **Preliminary Conference** | Uniform Rules § 202.12 — required in Supreme Court | IRCP 16 | ⚠️ Mandatory preliminary conference — generates all downstream deadlines |
| **Compliance Conference** | Uniform Rules § 202.19 | N/A | ⚠️ NY-specific status conference mid-discovery |

> ⚠️ **Critical: New York's response deadlines are 20 days** for interrogatories, document demands, and notices to admit — the shortest of any state AutoDiscovery supports. Every deadline fork must reflect this.

#### ⏰ New York CPLR Deadline Table

| Deadline | Trigger | Days | Notes |
|----------|---------|------|-------|
| **Interrogatory responses** | Service | **+20 days** | CPLR 3133 — shortest in platform |
| **Document demand responses** | Service | **+20 days** | CPLR 3120 |
| **Notice to admit responses** | Service | **+20 days** | CPLR 3123; failure = admitted |
| **Deposition notice** | Before deposition | +20 days minimum | CPLR 3106 |
| **Bill of particulars** | After demand | +30 days | CPLR 3042 |
| **Expert disclosure** | Per court order | Per scheduling order | CPLR 3101(d) — no statutory default |
| **Note of Issue** | After discovery complete | Per scheduling order | Triggers discovery close |
| **Preliminary conference** | After RJI filed | ~45 days | Uniform Rules § 202.12 |
| **Compliance conference** | Mid-discovery | Per court order | Uniform Rules § 202.19 |

---

### 📄 **NYSCEF — New York State Courts Electronic Filing**

NYSCEF (New York State Courts Electronic Filing) is mandatory in most NYC Supreme Court matters and affects deadline calculations:

| NYSCEF Rule | Impact | AutoDiscovery Implementation |
|-------------|--------|------------------------------|
| **E-filed documents served via NYSCEF** | Service timestamp = NYSCEF filing time | Deadline calculations must use NYSCEF timestamp, not postal service |
| **After-hours NYSCEF filing** | Filed after 11:59 PM = filed next business day | AutoDiscovery must calculate from next business day |
| **System unavailability** | NYSCEF outage = extended deadline | Alert users when NYSCEF status uncertain |
| **Mandatory e-filing counties** | NYC (NY, Kings, Queens, Bronx, Richmond), Albany, Westchester, Erie, and growing | Flag mandatory e-filing at case creation |
| **Optional e-filing counties** | Remaining counties — parties opt in | Track e-filing consent status |

> **Action:** Monitor NYSCEF mandatory county expansion — list grows regularly. Subscribe to OCA (Office of Court Administration) notices.

---

### 🏛️ **NYC Uniform Rules — Commercial Division**

For high-value commercial cases (Commercial Division of Supreme Court), additional rules apply:

| Uniform Rule | Topic | Implementation |
|--------------|-------|----------------|
| **§ 202.70(g) Rule 8** | Interrogatories limited to 25 in Commercial Division | Enforce 25-limit flag for commercial cases |
| **§ 202.70(g) Rule 11-d** | ESI disclosure requirements | ESI protocol mandatory in Commercial Division |
| **§ 202.70(g) Rule 14** | Expert disclosure — Commercial Division specifics | Expert module adjustment for Commercial Division |

---

### ⚖️ **New York UPL Analysis**

| Authority | Provision | Relevance |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Judiciary Law § 478** | UPL prohibition — criminal misdemeanor | AutoDiscovery must not constitute practice of law |
| **Judiciary Law § 476-a** | Attorney General may seek injunction against UPL | AG enforcement risk |
| **NY RPC 5.5** | Multi-jurisdictional practice | Out-of-state attorney access |
| **NY RPC 1.1** | Competence includes technology | Supports use |
| **NYSBA Ethics Hotline** | (800) 342-3661 | Submit informal inquiry pre-launch |

---

### 🔒 **New York Privacy & Data Security**

| Law | Requirement | AutoDiscovery Compliance |
|-----|-------------|--------------------------|
| **NY SHIELD Act (Gen. Bus. Law § 899-bb)** | Expanded data breach notification; reasonable security required | Midnight ZK architecture satisfies reasonable security standard |
| **NY SHIELD Act — Notification** | Data breach notification — most expedient time (no fixed window) | Incident response plan documented |
| **NYCPA (proposed 2024)** | NYC Consumer Privacy Act — pending | Monitor; may require updates if enacted |
| **NY RPC 1.6** | Attorney confidentiality | ZK selective disclosure satisfies |
| **HIPAA (Federal)** | Medical records | Client-side; AutoDiscovery holds hashes only |

## 🇺🇸 PHASE 10 — Remaining States & FRCP (Q3–Q4 2028)

### National Coverage Model

By Phase 10 the 45-day state launch template is fully optimized. The Jurisdiction Research Team runs parallel batch pipelines. The goal is **full 50-state + FRCP coverage by end of 2028**.

**Prioritization criteria for remaining states:**
1. **Litigation volume** — civil cases filed per year (public NCSC court statistics)
2. **Average case value** — higher value = more sanction risk = more AutoDiscovery value
3. **Bar association receptivity** — states with active legal tech committees move faster
4. **Rule complexity** — simpler rules (close to FRCP model) are batched together
5. **Geographic clustering** — states in same region share bar association relationships

---

### 📦 Batch A — Western States (Q1 2028)

| State | Rules | Primary Market | Notable Complexity | FRCP Similarity |
|-------|-------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Colorado** | Colo. R. Civ. P. | Denver (Denver District Court) | Denver County local rules; ESI protocols | High — closely tracks FRCP |
| **Nevada** | NRCP | Las Vegas (Clark County), Reno (Washoe County) | Nevada adopted revised NRCP in 2019 closely tracking FRCP | Very high |
| **Arizona** | Ariz. R. Civ. P. | Maricopa County (Phoenix) | Arizona added mandatory initial disclosure with substantive documents in 2018 — major divergence | Medium |
| **New Mexico** | NMRA | Bernalillo County (Albuquerque) | NMRA tracks FRCP closely; small market but geographically adjacent to TX/CO | High |

**Batch A Key Divergences:**
- **Arizona** mandatory initial disclosure includes actual documents (not just lists) — unique in US, must build document attachment to initial disclosure step
- **Colorado** has local patent rules and complex commercial division rules (similar to NY Commercial Division)
- **Nevada** 2019 NRCP overhaul closely mirrors FRCP — fastest launch candidate in Batch A

**Batch A Checklist:**
- [ ] NRCP (Nevada) audit — fast track, very close to FRCP
- [ ] Arizona mandatory initial disclosure with documents implemented
- [ ] Colorado District Court commercial division rules mapped
- [ ] New Mexico NMRA audit
- [ ] 4 state UPL memos + bar ethics inquiries

### 📦 Batch B — Southeast States (Q2 2028)

| State | Rules | Primary Market | Notable Complexity | FRCP Similarity |
|-------|-------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Georgia** | Ga. Code Ann. | Fulton County (Atlanta) | Georgia still uses some older discovery structures; Atlanta local rules complex | Medium |
| **North Carolina** | NC R. Civ. P. | Mecklenburg County (Charlotte), Wake County (Raleigh) | NC tracks FRCP closely post-2011 amendments | High |
| **South Carolina** | SC R. Civ. P. | Richland County (Columbia), Charleston County | Tracks FRCP closely; smaller market | High |

**Batch B Key Divergences:**
- **Virginia** has no mandatory initial disclosures in state court — similar to California's omission
- **Georgia** uses a "Certificate of Service" filing requirement unique to state

- [ ] Georgia certificate of service requirement implemented
- [ ] NC + SC audits — FRCP-adjacent, accelerated timeline
- [ ] 4 state UPL memos + bar ethics inquiries

### 📦 Batch C — Northeast States (Q2 2028)

| State | Rules | Primary Market | Notable Complexity | FRCP Similarity |
|-------|-------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Pennsylvania** | Pa. R. Civ. P. | Philadelphia County, Allegheny County (Pittsburgh) | Philadelphia local rules complex; discovery responses **20 days** (similar to NY) | Medium |
| **New Jersey** | N.J. Ct. R. | Essex County (Newark), Bergen County | NJ tracks FRCP closely; mandatory case management | High |
| **Connecticut** | Conn. Practice Book | Hartford County, Fairfield County | CT uses Practice Book rules (not separate civil rules); unique structure | Medium |
| **Massachusetts** | Mass. R. Civ. P. | Suffolk County (Boston) | Tracks FRCP; strong legal tech community in Boston | High |

**Batch C Key Divergences:**
- **Pennsylvania** Philadelphia discovery response deadline is **20 days** — same as New York, must fork
- **Connecticut** Practice Book structure is unique — rules are numbered differently from other states
- **New Jersey** has mandatory **Case Management Conference** within 90 days of first answer

**Batch C Checklist:**
- [ ] Pennsylvania Philadelphia 20-day response deadline implemented
- [ ] Connecticut Practice Book rule numbering mapped to AutoDiscovery workflow
- [ ] NJ mandatory case management conference workflow
- [ ] MA audit — FRCP-adjacent, fast track
- [ ] 4 state UPL memos + bar ethics inquiries

### 📦 Batch D — Midwest States (Q3 2028)

| State | Rules | Primary Market | Notable Complexity | FRCP Similarity |
|-------|-------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Michigan** | MCR | Wayne County (Detroit), Kent County (Grand Rapids) | Michigan Court Rules track FRCP; Detroit local rules | High |
| **Wisconsin** | Wis. Stat. ch. 804 | Milwaukee County, Dane County (Madison) | Wisconsin discovery statutes (not separate rules) — different structure | Medium |
| **Minnesota** | Minn. R. Civ. P. | Hennepin County (Minneapolis), Ramsey County (St. Paul) | Tracks FRCP closely; mandatory ADR before trial | High |
| **Missouri** | Mo. R. Civ. P. | Jackson County (Kansas City), St. Louis City | Missouri has no mandatory initial disclosures in state court | Medium |

**Batch D Key Divergences:**
- **Wisconsin** discovery is governed by statutes (ch. 804), not separate civil rules — unique structure similar to California
- **Missouri** no mandatory initial disclosures — same fork as California/Virginia
- **Minnesota** mandatory ADR (Alternative Dispute Resolution) before trial — track ADR deadlines

**Batch D Checklist:**
- [ ] Wisconsin ch. 804 statutory discovery audit (similar approach to CCP)
- [ ] Missouri no-initial-disclosure workflow
- [ ] Minnesota ADR deadline tracking implemented
- [ ] Michigan MCR audit — FRCP-adjacent, fast track

### 📦 Batch E — Remaining 22 States (Q3–Q4 2028)

| Group | States | Approach |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Mountain/Plains** | MT, ID (fed), WY, ND, SD, NE, KS | FRCP-adjacent; fast track |
| **Southern** | AL, MS, LA, AR, TN, KY, WV | Moderate complexity; local rules vary |
| **New England** | ME, VT, NH, RI | Small markets; FRCP-adjacent |
| **Mid-Atlantic** | MD, DE | Moderate; Delaware corporate law complex |
| **Pacific** | OR, HI, AK | Oregon tracks WA closely; HI and AK small markets |

> **Batch E Strategy:** Pair each state with a Jurisdiction Research Team member. Use the 45-day template. States that closely track FRCP (MT, WY, OR) are completed in 30 days. States with unique structures (LA — civil law system; DE — Court of Chancery) get extended timelines.

**Batch E Special Notes:**
- **Louisiana** — only US state using civil law (Napoleonic Code) tradition; La. Code Civ. P. diverges fundamentally — allocate **90 days** and a Louisiana-specific attorney review
- **Delaware** — Court of Chancery handles corporate disputes; unique discovery rules for equity proceedings
- **Oregon** — closely tracks Washington CR (already built); fast-track estimate: 20 days

### ⚖️ **Federal (FRCP) — All Federal District Courts (Q4 2028)**

Adding FRCP support unlocks every federal case filed by AutoDiscovery users — the largest single rule pack addition.

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Rules** | Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) — currently at Dec. 1, 2023 amendments |
| **Governing Body** | Judicial Conference of the United States — Rules Advisory Committees |
| **Scope** | All 94 Federal District Courts |
| **Local Rule Complexity** | Each of 94 districts has its own local rules — major implementation effort |
| **E-filing system** | CM/ECF (Case Management/Electronic Case Files) — affects service timestamp logic |
| **ESI** | Sedona Conference Principles apply; many districts have ESI standing orders |

**Key FRCP Discovery Rules (already form the basis of IRCP/URCP):**

| Rule | Title | AutoDiscovery Impact |
|------|-------|---------------------|
| **FRCP 16** | Scheduling | Foundation already built in Idaho |
| **FRCP 26(a)(1)** | Initial Disclosures — 14 days | Same as IRCP — minimal delta |
| **FRCP 26(a)(2)** | Expert Disclosures | Same as IRCP — minimal delta |
| **FRCP 26(b)(1)** | Proportionality | Same as IRCP — minimal delta |
| **FRCP 33** | Interrogatories — 25 limit, 30-day response | ⚠️ FRCP = **30 days** (IRCP = 28) |
| **FRCP 34** | RFP — 30-day response | ⚠️ FRCP = **30 days** (IRCP = 28) |
| **FRCP 36** | RFA — 30-day response | ⚠️ FRCP = **30 days** (IRCP = 28) |
| **FRCP 37** | Sanctions | Same as IRCP |

> ⚠️ FRCP response deadlines are **30 days** (not 28 like Idaho). A small but critical fork.

**FRCP Launch Checklist:**
- [ ] FRCP rule pack audit — delta from IRCP documented
- [ ] 30-day response deadline fork implemented for FRCP 33/34/36
- [ ] CM/ECF timestamp logic implemented (mirrors NYSCEF approach)
- [ ] 10 representative federal district local rules mapped (SDNY, CDCA, NDIL, SDTX, EDPA priority)
- [ ] Local rule monitoring system: subscribe to all 94 district court rule update notifications
- [ ] Federal-licensed attorney review (any admitted to federal district bar)
- [ ] `jurisdiction-registry` FRCP rule pack v1.0 deployed
