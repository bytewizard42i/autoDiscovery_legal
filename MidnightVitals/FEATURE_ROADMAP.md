**Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: Feb 22, 2026

- [x] Status colors: green (healthy), amber (warning), red (critical), gray (unknown)
- [x] Mock provider returns simulated healthy/warning/error states

### v0.3.0 — Console Log ✅

- [x] Scrollable log area with newest entries on top
- [x] Timestamped entries with natural-language messages
- [x] Log levels: action (blue), info (white), success (green), warning (amber), error (red)

### v0.3.5 — Card Layout Settings ✅

- [x] Settings dropdown on stethoscope button (chevron menu)
- [x] User can choose diagnostic card position: **Top**, **Left**, or **Right**
- [x] **Top**: Slim horizontal pill strip above CLI (default, most space-efficient)
- [x] **Left**: Vertical card column on the left, CLI fills the right
- [x] **Right**: Vertical card column on the right, CLI fills the left
- [x] Card position preference persists in localStorage
- [x] Cards adapt layout (inline pills for top, compact stacked cards for sidebar)
- [x] Smooth transitions between layouts

### v0.3.7 — Interaction Tracking ✅

- [x] `useVitalsInteraction()` hook for hover and click logging
- [x] Debounced hover events (3s cooldown per element label)
- [x] Immediate click event logging
- [x] Three API styles: spread both, hover-only, click-only
- [x] Wired into all DemoLand pages: layout, dashboard, login, search, compliance, settings, case-contacts

### v0.3.8 — Floating Panel Mode ✅

- [x] Two panel modes: **Docked** (bottom-fixed, classic) and **Floating** (free-positioned window)
- [x] Drag-to-move via title bar in floating mode
- [x] Resize from bottom-right corner in floating mode (width + height)
- [x] Float/Dock toggle button in panel header
- [x] Panel mode selectable from stethoscope settings dropdown
- [x] Position, size, and mode preference persist in localStorage across sessions
- [x] Clamped to viewport edges so the panel can't go off-screen

- [ ] Export diagnostic report as PDF

### v2.2.0 — Analytics

## Ideas Backlog (Unscheduled)

These are ideas that might be valuable but haven't been prioritized yet:

- **Contract state diff viewer** — Show what changed in contract state after a transaction
- **Proof size analyzer** — Visualize ZK proof sizes and optimization opportunities
- **Network mempool viewer** — See pending transactions before confirmation
- **Contract upgrade tracker** — Monitor when contracts are redeployed
- **Community health dashboard** — Aggregate anonymized health data from all MidnightVitals users (opt-in)
- **AI-powered error diagnosis** — Feed error logs to an LLM for natural-language debugging suggestions
- **Mobile companion app** — Get health alerts on your phone
- **Browser extension** — Quick vitals check without opening the DApp
- **Contract interaction simulator** — "Dry run" a transaction before submitting
- **Midnight network status page** — Public status page showing preprod/mainnet health
